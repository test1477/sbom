Yes ✅ the workflow I shared will work for **all supported languages** because of

```yaml
with:
  languages: auto
```

That line makes **CodeQL auto-detect the languages** in the repo.

So if a repo only has:

* **Python** → only Python gets scanned
* **Java** → only Java gets scanned
* **Mixed (e.g., Java + JavaScript)** → both get scanned
* **Go, Ruby, C#, C++** → CodeQL will pick those up too

### 🔧 Supported Languages for `languages: auto`

CodeQL supports the following languages out of the box:

* C / C++
* C#
* Go
* Java
* JavaScript / TypeScript
* Python
* Ruby

(If a repo doesn’t use one of these, CodeQL just won’t run for that language.)

### ✅ Final Notes for Org Rollout

* **With GHAS enabled** → results go into the **Security tab** automatically.
* **Without GHAS** → results only stay in the workflow run (logs + artifacts).
* **Dependency Review** always works, free for all.

👉 Do you want me to now show you the **org-level reusable workflow** version (so all repos just “call” it), instead of copy-pasting the same YAML everywhere?
